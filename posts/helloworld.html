                Welcome to my blog! After almost of decade of wanting to create a personal blog, this blog post officially marks the beginning of my blogging journey! 
                Most people offline know me as a man of few words, but I do, in fact, think deeply about a gamut of topics and ideas. 
                I hope this blog can serve as a journey through my mind and also be a place for me to organize and memorialize my random thoughts. 
            </p>

            <p>
                There will be no rhyme or reason to this blog. It was simply be whatever I want to share that is on my mind. 
                It could be an epiphany that I had while backpacking through the Enchanted Valley, or possibly a recipe for a stew that I serendipitously concocted one night. 
                It could be a story about an utterly peculiar stranger I met while floating down the Danube, or a rant about a bad day that I had.
            </p>
